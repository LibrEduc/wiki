**v2.1.5.04.11**

add functionality for Arduino alone : use of HC-SR04

<del>//no// upload on Arduino Mega</del>

with 3 or more servo-motor, seems to become less reactive, with long time response

embed adobe air

portable, with no use of 'user/docs'

<del>choose extension visible : click in a list of auto detected extension which you want to use</del>

the program regularly closes in bluetooth mode (win8.1)

Problem upload the code generated by the program. I have to go through the Arduino IDE . ( win8.1 )
